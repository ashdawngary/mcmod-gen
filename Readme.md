# mcmod-gen  
mcmod-gen or macromode code generator is a set of programs that have been created over the years by me for writing automation scripts.  All the code boils down to 'macromod code' which is an extremely watered down language with basic-like syntax.  

Search macromod on google to find the liteloader mod.  All versions have the same underlying components.  

## Purpose of mcmod-gen:

Look at http://eq2.co.uk/minecraft/mods/mod_macros_0.8.5_readme.txt , the readme for macromod.  Upon skimming it, you will find that most of the stuff is extremely bare.  The mod seemed to just be an extension of your keyboard, or a _macro_.  

Programs/ macros in this language were not complete at all.  The syntax for the language was mostly incomplete.  There were no standard loops.  There were only two types of variables: booleans and integers.  And im pretty sure booleans are just 1 bit integers.

The syntax of macromod is quite hard to get over and there are weird `%` signs that are sometimes required and sometimes not making the whole thing a mess all around. 

As a aspiring automator, I was looking for a system that would provide me the ability to write powerful  macros that would provide me with competitive advantages in game while still being fully autonomous.  I wanted to press the `F` key and then I would essentially win the game.  

Two current Iterations of Code Generation:
- Legacy (https://github.com/ashdawngary/mcmod-gen/tree/master/legacy%20compiler)
- Alpha (https://github.com/ashdawngary/mcmod-gen/tree/master/Alpha%20NoType%20Compiler)

We recommend you try Alpha, but sometimes Legacy works better (if you want to suffer with macromod)
